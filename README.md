# Spring Reverb

## Version
Right now the project is v1.0

It's a fully working prototype, but still a breadboard prototype.

## Description
I wanted to design my own analog spring reverb schematic that would work with most of the spring tanks available on the market (Accutronics Type 4 and Type 8 for example).

The idea was to make something similar to the [Anasound Element Spring Reverb](https://anasounds.com/element-spring-reverb/). 

This project is not a clone of the Anasound Element.
