# Spring Reverb

## Description

This is a [LibrePCB](https://librepcb.org) project!

I wanted to design my own analog spring reverb schematic that would work with most of the spring tanks available on the market (Accutronics Type 4 and Type 8 for example).

The idea was to make something similar to the ([Anasound Element Spring Reverb](https://anasounds.com/element-spring-reverb/)). 

This project is not a clone of the Anasound Element.
